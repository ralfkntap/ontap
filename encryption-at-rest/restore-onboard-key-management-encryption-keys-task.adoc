If need to restore an onboard key management encryption key, you first verify that a key needs to be restored, then you can set up the Onboard Key Manager to restore the key.

.What you'll need

* If you are using NSE with an external key management (KMIP) server, you must have deleted
the external key manager database.
+
link:delete-key-management-database-task.html[Transitioning to onboard key management from external key management]

* You must be a cluster administrator to perform this task.

== Steps for ONTAP 9.6 and later

. Verify that the key needs to be restored: +
`security key-manager key query -node _node_`

. If you are running ONTAP 9.8 and later, and your root volume is encrypted, complete <<root_volume_encrypted>>.
+
If you are running ONTAP 9.6 or 9.7, or if you are running ONTAP 9.8 or later and your root volume is not encrypted, skip this step.

. Restore the key: +
`security key-manager onboard sync`
+
For complete command syntax, see the man pages.
+
The following ONTAP 9.6 command synchronize the keys in the onboard key hierarchy:
+
----
cluster1::> security key-manager onboard sync

Enter the cluster-wide passphrase for onboard key management in Vserver "cluster1"::    <32..256 ASCII characters long text>
----

. At the passphrase prompt, enter the onboard key management passphrase for the cluster.

== Steps for ONTAP 9.5 and earlier

. Verify that the key needs to be restored: +
`security key-manager key show`

. If you are running ONTAP 9.8 and later, and your root volume is encrypted, complete <<root_volume_encrypted>>.
+
If you are running ONTAP 9.6 or 9.7, or if you are running ONTAP 9.8 or later and your root volume is not encrypted, skip this step.

. Restore the key: +
`security key-manager setup -node _node_`
+
For complete command syntax, see the man pages.

. At the passphrase prompt, enter the onboard key management passphrase for the cluster.

== Steps if the root volume is encrypted [[root_volume_encrypted]]

If you are running ONTAP 9.8 and later, and your root volume is encrypted, you must set an onboard key management recovery passphrase with the boot menu.

. Boot the node to the boot menu and select option `(10) Set onboard key management recovery secrets`.
. Enter `y` to use this option.
. At the prompt, enter the onboard key management passphrase for the cluster.
. At the prompt, enter the backup key data.
+
The node returns to the boot menu.

. From the boot menu, select option `(1) Normal Boot`.
